# Software-Project-Tracker


Description

Project Tracker GUI is a desktop application built with Java Swing.
It allows users to track and save project information through a simple form interface.
All records are stored in a text file (projects.txt) in a clear and readable format.

Features

- Enter project details: Project Name, Team Leader, Team Size, Project Type, and Start Date

- Save project records to projects.txt with a structured layout

- Input validation: required fields must be filled; otherwise, an error message is displayed

- Clear the form easily with the Clear button

- Automatically logs the Record Time for each entry

Technologies

- Java SE

- Java Swing (JFrame, JPanel, JButton, JTextField, JComboBox)

- File I/O (FileWriter)

- JOptionPane for user messages

- DateTimeFormatter for date and time

Usage

- Open the project in Eclipse or any Java IDE

- Fill out the project form:

- Project Name

- Team Leader

- Team Size

- Project Type

- Start Date

Click Save:

- If all required fields are filled, the project is saved and a success message appears

- If fields are missing, an error message is shown

- Click Clear to reset the form

- Check projects.txt in the project’s root folder for saved records


Notes

- The file is opened in append mode, so new projects are added without overwriting previous entries

- If projects.txt does not appear in Eclipse, refresh the project (F5) in the Project Explorer

- Multiple projects can be tracked in the same file
